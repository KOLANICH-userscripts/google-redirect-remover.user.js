Google Redirect Remover Userscript
==================================

Googlag tracks which links were clicked by users. In order to track clicks even from users with JS disabled they return all the links with redirects, and then remove the redirects with JS, in the same time adding tracking with JS.

This userscripts removes the redirects itself, without Googlag-supplied JS.
